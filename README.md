We leverage the python framework Anvil (more info at https://anvil.works) to accept input and display the data
If there is a special case where sharing that data would be beneficial to the community at large we can do that
levearing an uplink from the Anvil system.  If you are familiar with Python this gives a very simple method to 
iterate through the data
